```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(rethinking)
```

I'm skipping the easy problems as they don't require any coding.

#MEDIUM

##M1
Simulate observed heights from following model:
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
    mu ~ Normal(0,10)
    sigma ~ Uniform(0,10)
    
```{r}
#first sample from mu prior
mu_sample = rnorm(1e4, mean=0, sd=10)

#then from sigma 
sigma_sample = runif(1e4,min=0, max=10)

#and finally simulate the observed values
observed_sim = rnorm(1e4, mean=mu_sample, sd=sigma_sample)

simplehist(observed_sim) #as expected from the priors
```

##M2
Translate the model from M1 into map formula
```{r}
flist = alist(
    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ) ,
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 10 )
)
```

Skip the M3 - doesnt require coding and is the opposite of M2
#Skip M4-M6 - come back later

#HARD

##H1
