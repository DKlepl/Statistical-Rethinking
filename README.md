# Statistical-Rethinking

  My code accompanied with notes from the bayesian stats course Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath. 
In the folder Practice are my solutions to the practice tasks at the end of each chapter. The solutions mostly use the material and code discussed in the associated chapter. Sometimes I add nicer code, plots and geeky bonus solutions.
