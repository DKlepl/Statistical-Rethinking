# Statistical-Rethinking

Code from the bayesian stats course Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath accompanied with my notes and adjusted code in some cases. 
In the folder Practice are my solutions to the practice tasks at the end of each chapter. The solutions mostly use the material and code discussed in the associated chapter. Sometimes I add nicer code, plots and geeky bonus ideas.
